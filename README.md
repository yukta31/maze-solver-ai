# Maze Solver using AI Search Algorithms

This project implements an AI-based maze solver using search algorithms including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*.

## ðŸ§© Objective

To explore pathfinding techniques by solving mazes programmatically, visualizing optimal or complete paths using different algorithms.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Implemented

- âœ… Depth-First Search (DFS)
- âœ… Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- âœ… A* Search (with Manhattan heuristic)

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `maze_solver.py`: Core implementation

## ðŸ“Š Output

Displays the maze and path traced by each algorithm. Outputs steps taken, visited nodes, and final solution length.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python maze_solver.py
